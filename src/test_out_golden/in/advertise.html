<h2>Purple.com Advertising Guidelines</h2>

<p> You may advertise on purple.com.  Why you would do so is
    somewhat different than advertising on other sites, so please
    do read these guidelines.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><ul>
    <li> Up to three words, about 20 characters max</li>
    <li> This is on the root page only</li>
    <li> Your ad will appear instead of "your ad here"</li>
    <li> The redirect to blank purple still happens after a couple seconds</li>
    <li> Your ad doesn't get me in trouble or cause me serious hassle</li>
    <li> If your content is NSFW, you link through an intermediate page
	that gives fair warning and explanation</li>
</ul></li></p>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>The cost is 50 per day for the first two words.  For longer ads, the
    price is 50+50*(w-2)^2 per day.  I.e., 100 for three words, 300 for
    four words, etc.  For images, the price is 0.10 per pixel per day.  So
    an 88x31 tag (2728 pixels) would cost 272.80 per day.  We are
    interested in the page loading quickly.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>You may only advertise on the <a href="index.html">root page</a>.
    That page receives about 15,000 views per day (of which some
    are surely robots and other automated entities).  Extensive
    anecdotal evidence suggests that the root page is viewed by
    people testing their browsers or simply playing with common
    English words.  Changes to that page tend to elicit comments
    and blog posts, so at least some people visit regularly and
    notice changes.</p>

<p>Much of that traffic depends on the page being essentially
    blank purple and loading very fast.  I therefore require
    advertising to respect those constraints.  As such, you are
    limited to three words (and to about 20 characters, at our
    discretion).</p>

<p>Since there is no substantive content on the root page, I can't
    help you target your advertisement to your audience.  I
    suspect the potential interest is precisely the fact that you
    would be paying to reach an unknown audience, for example to
    publicise a new product launch.</p>

<p> In addition, I require that neither the words of your ad nor
    the initial page to which they jump should be obviously
    illegal in France, the United Kingdom, or the United States.
    They should also not be likely to offend too seriously in
    those countries.  (So please don't ask us to link to a cartoon
    of Mohammad or something that will cause us to be hassled,
    even if I take no personal position on your content.)</p>

<p>
    If you want to link through to something questionable or NSFW
    (not safe for work), please link through an intermediate page
    which provides clear and adequate warning of what's about to
    happen (in English) and does not redirect for at least five
    seconds.  That should be enough to let people who don't want
    to continue on to abort.</p>

<p> The pricing may vary with time and is designed to make
    sponsored links the exception and not the rule.  (That
    simplifies my life for now and increases the effect of your
    advertisement.)  It is currently 20 euros (or pound sterling)
    per day or 30 U.S. dollars per day.</p>

<p> I am not currently planning on automating this service (beyond
    using cron to swap in your ad and pull it out again), even
    though my fingers twitch to write a simple word auction
    system.  But I don't think that's worth my time.  If you are
    interested in advertising, please email me, username "jeff".
    Please don't spam me.  Please use a clear subject.  Please
    contact me in advance of when you want your ad to run so that
    we have time to handle payment and set up the page.</p>

<p>
    If you send me mail that does not appear to be constructive or
    serious, I may simply ignore it (and flag it as spam for my
    spam filter to handle next time).</p>

<p>
    I am open to constructive feedback on the advertising program.
    My purpose is to cover my (miniscule) costs of running the
    site.  If I buy myself some good chocolate out of it, that's a
    nice plus.</p>
