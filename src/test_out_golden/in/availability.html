<h2>Purple.com Availability Guidelines</h2>

<h4>Purple.com is <u>not</u> for sale</h4>


<p>We do use purple.com. We understand that those who are not
    technically inclined nor in the know may not see
    that. That's ok. We don't think any less of those who
    don't know our personal business.</p>


<h4>Purple.com <u>is</u> available for lease or licensing</h4>

<p> For further information on any of these options, please
    email us.<b>All numbers are either in GBP or in EUR, as
    you wish.</b> But if we sign a contract, the currency is
    determined by whether we write the contract under French
    or UK law.</p>

<p><b>1.  Advertising.</b>  You may place a text ad on the
    main purple page (<a
href="http://www.purple.com/index.html">http://www.purple.com/index.html</a>).
    See the <a
    href="advertise.html">advertising</a> page for full
    details.
</p>

<p>The main page currently redirects to blank purple after 2
    seconds.  You may increase the delay time for a daily
    price that is 20% of your ad price times the square of the
    number of seconds you wish to add.</p>

<p> <b>2.  Lease the root page.</b>  You may lease the single
page (entry point) <a
    href="http://www.purple.com/">http://www.purple.com/</a>
    at the rate of 5000 per month. We would redirect that one
    page to the (non-purple) address of your choice. Email
    addresses at purple are available for 10 each per month if
    you are leasing the main entry point.  <!-- You would have
    to put a comment like this in the first 24x80 screen of
    html where we redirect, letting people know where they can
    find information about purple.com leasing. --></p>


<p> <b>3.  Lease a subdomain.</b>  You may lease sub-domains
    of purple (other than www) for 1000 per month. You must
    host your own content: we merely point DNS at the IP of
    your choice. For 100 per month additional you may handle
    all email to your sub-domain of purple. Individual email
    addresses at purple or at your sub-domain are otherwise
    available for 10 each per month.</p>


<p> <b>4.  License the entire site.</b>  You may license all
    of purple.com, giving you the right to put all of your
    content at www.purple.com, including hosting the site
    itself. You would be required to maintain forwarding on
    certain email addresses and redirects on a small number of
    URL's, but none with names that should cause problems. The
    cost of licensing the entire site is a one-time fee of
    750,000 plus a monthly maintenance fee of 100 which may be
    paid in advance annually.</p>

<p> <b>5.  Have an email address.</b>  You may have an address
    at friends.purple.com for 50 per month. The address is
    licensed to you as long as you keep paying. You may do
    anything you want with it except represent yourself as
    having a relationship with purple.com other than leasing
    the address or addresses you lease. You may not do
    anything that gets us in legal trouble, and you may not
    use it as a spam return address. We would forward that
    address to the address of your choice: we would not offer
    actual storage.</p>


<h4>Some questions and their answers</h4>

<p> <b>Q.</b> Why is this so expensive?</p>


<p> <b>A.</b> To make my life simple.</p>


<p>-</p>

<p> <b>Q.</b> This is too expensive! Won't you bring the price
    down?</p>


<p> <b>A.</b> The price is not negotiable. Everyone has
    different ideas of expensive. If you feel this is too
    expensive, you are welcome to find a less expensive domain
    name.</p>


<p>-</p>

<p> <b>Q.</b> What restrictions would I have on what I can do
    with my sub-domain of purple?</p>


<p> <b>A.</b> We impose no restrictions, except that it must
    be legal, must not get us in legal problems, can't be for
    purposes of spamming, etc.</p>


<p>-</p>

<p> <b>Q.</b> Can I have an email address without paying all
    those fees?</p>


<p> <b>A.</b> No. That wouldn't be simple. (It doesn't
    scale.)</p>


<p>-</p>

<p> <b>Q.</b> Why is <a
    href="http://www.purple.com/">http://www.purple.com/</a>
    nearly all purple? Why does it link to a purple page?</p>


<p> <b>A.</b> It makes my life simple.</p>


<p>-</p>

<p> <b>Q.</b> Isn't there more?</p>


<p> <b>A.</b> No.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p> <b>Q.</b> I don't want to lease, I want to buy!</p>

<p> <b>A.</b> Leasing is a fairly standard business structure.
    In most contexts you can achieve most of the rights you'd
    like from purchase via lease, although you often have to
    enumerate what you want.  If you really feel that leasing
    purple.com doesn't work for you and you don't have a
    credible argument for why, understand that I will wonder
    what you are up to.</p>
