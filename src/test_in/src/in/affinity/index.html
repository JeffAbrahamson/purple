<h1>Purple Affinity</h1>

<p> Be a part of purple in your own way. Display one of these images
on your web pages.  It's free and it's pointless!

<p>
To use any of these buttons, just copy the html that follows them into
your web page to get a nice, purple, clickable button of your own.
You're welcome to copy the images to your own web page if you prefer.
