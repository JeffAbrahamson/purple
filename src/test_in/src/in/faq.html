<b>Q: This is really lilac / pink / other, not exactly purple. Could
you make it more purple?</b>
<br>
A: No. (What color it appears is also dependent on your monitor and
its calibration.)  Actually, the page used to be #DD00FF from circa
1994 until late 2006, resulting in numerous complaints that it was not
quite purple.  On 6-Nov-2006 I changed it to #7D26CD based on various
recommendations.  It's darker than the old purple, but more clearly
purple.  You can compare it to blue <a href="blue.html">here</a>.  You
can compare it to not purple <a href="http://notpurple.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>Q: Are there any games?</b>
<br>
A: You can chase the <a
href="http://www.purple.com/purple.html">purple squirrel</a>.  He is
animated against a purple background.  Click on him to win.
The game restarts immediately after each win,
only the squirrel knows.</p>

<p>

<b>Q: This is weird / useless / other.</b>
