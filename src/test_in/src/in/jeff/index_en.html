<h1>Jeff Abrahamson</h1>

<H2>Some gratuitous information about me.</H2>


<P>I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States.  I <a
href="http://www.purple.com/walk-to-work/">lived</a> in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, on the east coast of the United States, for 19 years.
I now live in Nantes.
Along the way my life has carried me to Boston, San Francisco, Paris, and London.

<P>I studied mathematics at
<A HREF="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</A> from 1983 to 1988, with
a year off in 1985-1986 living and studying in Paris. I
did graduate work in theoretical mathematics at the
<A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu">University of
Pennsylvania</A> from 1988-1990.</p>

<P>For ten years I worked in industry as a software engineer before
returning to academia. I did a <a
href="http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jeffa/">PhD</a> in <a
href="http://www.cs.drexel.edu/">computer science</a> at <a
href="http://www.drexel.edu/">Drexel University</a> in Philadelphia
before moving to Nantes.  My professional life is mostly based in
London.  At first I worked in finance doing computer science.  In
April 2013 I joined Google London.</P>

<P>I speak French proficiently. I speak somewhat halting German. My
high school Latin suffices only for reading some inscriptions on
buildings and other parlor tricks.  I enjoy trekking, rowing, and bicycling.
Here's a <a href="pix/20070330-113946-2355-small.jpg">picture</a>
of me on a recent hiking trip (with Stéphane, March 2007).  I row with
<a href="http://www.una.asso.fr/">UNA</a>.</p>
